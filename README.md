### About Me

I am a front-end and full-stack developer who has been working in the web development field since 2008. I care about high quality UI/UX for both users and admins, writing organized and maintainable code, and the visual details.

- âš¡ I am working remotely at an awesome company called [Sparkbox](https://sparkbox.com).
- :earth_americas: I've worked on and off as a freelancer since 2013 but am no longer taking on new work.
- ðŸ”­ My latest fun little project on GitHub is a React version of the [Game of Go](https://github.com/jawinn/game-of-go-react).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about accessibility with the goal of becoming certified, and more advanced Typescript.
- :video_game: I'm also a hobbyist game developer and 3D artist working in Unity and learning Blender when I can find the time.
